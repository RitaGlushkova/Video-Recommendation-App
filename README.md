# Video Recommendation App

## Background

Before you continue to final projects we have to make sure that you can meaningfully contribute to a technical project.

This means that we need to be sure that you can create a Full Stack App.

## Challenge

In this project you will be building a project that fulfills the following User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all YouTube videos posted on the site
- As a user, I want to be able to post videos that I like from YouTube to my website.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete videos from the website that I no longer like.
- As a user, I want to be able to watch the videos embedded in the website.
- As a user, I want to be able to "Up Vote" a video if I like it.
- As a user, I want to be able to "Down Vote" a video if I dislike.

You don't need to worry about storing the video content itself - we'll rely on YouTube for this.
